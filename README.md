## Getting Started
Hey and welcome. You have started the development with the most advanced and easy form Builder

### Why BoomForm ?
ðŸ˜Ž Using Boomform you donâ€™t need to take care of data structure, fields re-rendering etcâ€¦ 

ðŸš€Boomform will do it for you. You just need to tell the program where your fields should be located and Boomform will automatically create a state for them and follow your fields lifecycle.

[Full documentation here](https://form.boomform.com/)

## Code Example
Just write the BoomForm component and pass as a child whatever content you want with the Input component.

```jsx
import React from 'react'
import { BoomForm, Input } from 'boomform'
 
const App = () => {
  return (
    <BoomForm>
      Simple Input:
      <Input id='1' type='text' />
    </BoomForm>
  )
}
 
export default App
```
There you go as easy as that. Now BoomForm is keeping all your state and following the input component lifecycle.
