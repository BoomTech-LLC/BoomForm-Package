## Getting Started
Hey and welcome. You have started the development with the most advanced and easy form Builder

### Why BoomForm ?
😎 Using Boomform you don’t need to take care of data structure, fields re rendering etc… 

🚀Boomform will do it for you. You just need to tell the program where your fields should be located and Boomform will automatically create a state for them and follow your fields lifecycle.
